This framework has been developed by Akvo and Zimmerman & Zimmerman.

Akvo is a non-profit organisation which creates and shares internet and mobile phone tools designed to make development projects more effective and transparent. Akvo helps everyone share knowledge, match more projects to funds, and simplify reporting. As an organisation with both development aid and IT expertise, Akvo strongly supports the IATI standard, and is actively engaged in its further development and implementation.



Zimmerman & Zimmerman
